Module 1: Patagonian Toothfish Project
-----------------------------

### Outcomes

This module contains a generic repository for source code of all write outcomes. Most of the source code are based in [Latex](http://www.latex-project.org/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but some specific outcomes were written using Microsoft. 

The outcomes (slides, reports, papers, chapters) will be stored here and should be bulleted in a chronological order:

- Report 1: Research Plan (RP)
- Report 2: Slides RP

Check out the current [Module site](http://jcquiroz.github.io/utas-aad-git/) to see how I've changed things.
